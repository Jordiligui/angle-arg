<h2>ANGLE 4 — SIX</h2>

<p>
The corridors stretch longer than memory allows.<br>
Shadows twist in impossible angles.<br>
The air vibrates with something not your own.<br>
Each step you take leaves traces you do not recognize.
</p>

<p>
You are observed.<br>
Always observed.<br>
Even in stillness, something skirts just beyond perception.
</p>

<p>
Collect the <span class="hint">capital letters</span> from the block above, in order.<br>
They will lead you forward.<br>
Add <b>.html</b> to reveal the next path.
</p>

<p>
Something waits, folded between what is seen and unseen.<br>
The page trembles beneath it. 
<span class="ghost">Hound</span>
</p>

<p>
You are not alone.<br>
Time bends around your pulse.<br>
And the angles... they are listening.
