<h2>ANGLE 1 — THE FIRST SHIFT</h2>

<p>
You found the first angle.<br>
That means you noticed the distortion too.
</p>

<p>
Some call it a whisper.<br>
Others call it static.<br>
Both are wrong.<br>
Static does not <i>move</i> toward you.
</p>

<p>
The shape is not supposed to exist in three dimensions.<br>
It presses against the edges. You feel it, don’t you?
</p>

<p>
To continue, locate the word that<br>
<code>does not belong here</code>.
</p>

<p>
This one:<br>
<span class="hidden">ACUTE</span>
</p>

<p>
Shift each letter by:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ 3 forward<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;− 1 backward<br>
(You know what that means.)
</p>

<p>
Then add <b>.html</b> to the end.<br>
That will open the next angle.
